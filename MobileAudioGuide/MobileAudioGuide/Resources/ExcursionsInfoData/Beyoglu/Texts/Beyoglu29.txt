In the center of Taksim Square rises one of the most modern monuments of Istanbul - the Monument of the Republic. It was erected in 1928 to the design of the Italian sculptor Pietro Canonica on the occasion of the fifth anniversary of the proclamation of the Turkish Republic.
The monument itself is a triumphal arch in the form of a Muslim mihrab. It is surrounded on both sides by the first president of the Turkish Republic, Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, his closest associates and the soldiers of the liberating army.
Curiously enough, this monument was the first monument in the history of Islamic Turkey with the image of human figures.
Note the two figures in uniform to the left of the Turkish leader. Their faces bear the features of Soviet Union Marshal Kliment Voroshilov and revolutionary Semyon Aralov.
Ataturk personally ordered the inclusion of these figures among his associates as a sign of gratitude to the USSR for its financial support and assistance in the fight against the enemies of the Republic. On the right of the ""father of the nation"" stands the faithful assistant and second president of Turkey Ismet Inönü and Field Marshal Fevzi Çakmak.
Nowadays, the monument ""Republic"" is the bright dominant feature of Taksim Square. Meetings and all kinds of demonstrations, rallies and festive ceremonies are often held near it.
