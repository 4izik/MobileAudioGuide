Just behind the Galata Bridge the Karakoy seaside district starts. It was named in the Middle Ages after the numerous Karaites community that lived here.
With the advent of the Ottomans, a large part of the Karaites emigrated to Eastern Europe and the Crimea. They were replaced by the representatives of various commercial estates.
The Genoese, Catalans, Venetians and Jews were actively building up Karakei with their ethnic neighborhoods.
By the beginning of the nineteenth century, it was one of the most prestigious areas of the city, where there were all kinds of insurance companies, banks, small industrial enterprises, as well as the city's largest seaport.
The port gained particular importance during the Crimean War, becoming a kind of terminal base of the allies of the Ottoman Empire.
Nowadays, Karakoy is famous for its fish market and numerous religious sites. It is also considered the youth center of Istanbul and is famous for its works of street art.
