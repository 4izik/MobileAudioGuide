Not everyone will notice the Ashkenazi synagogue with its three white arched portals on the top floor on Yuksak Kaldirim Street. It is so densely squeezed into the city's buildings that the best view of it is from the staircase adjacent to the street staircase. It is the only Ashkenazi Jewish synagogue in operation, not only in Istanbul, but in Turkey as a whole.
Generally speaking, the Jewish community in Constantinople dates back to the 4th century. At that time, its inhabitants lived compactly near the Copper Market in the center of the city. But Theodosius the Second, at the request of the clergy, expelled the Jews to the opposite shore of the Golden Horn.
No doubt such harassment played no small part in the fact that the Jews of Constantinople had a grudge against the Byzantines. Not surprisingly, unlike the Genoese, the Jews helped the Turks to capture the city.
With the advent of the Muslims, the community's situation improved considerably. The Jews were accorded a number of privileges and tax exemptions and were allowed to act as advisers to the sultan's palace. It was their economic activity that played an important role in the growth of the city's prosperity in the sixteenth century.
At that time, the community in Galata reached fifty thousand people.
By the end of the nineteenth century, Istanbul had become one of the largest centers of Jewish learning and culture in Europe. It was members of the community who brought book printing to the capital of the Ottoman Empire. And it is not for nothing that the Galata neighborhood is considered a book-lover's paradise until today. On its slopes are located the best bookshops in the city.
After the founding of the new state of Israel, most of the Jews migrated to their homeland. Today in all of Turkey there are about twenty-five thousand Jews, of whom only a few hundred are Ashkenazi and Karaites.
