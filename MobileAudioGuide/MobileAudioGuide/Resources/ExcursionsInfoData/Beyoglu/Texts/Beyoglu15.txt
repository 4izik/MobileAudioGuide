Walking along Istiklal Street and its surroundings, we have repeatedly mentioned the Pera district. This was the name of modern Beyoglu until the twenties. the twenties of the last century.
The word has Greek roots and, in fact, means ""outside"", ""on the other side"". This name was not chosen by chance, as at first Pera developed outside the city walls.
The Ottomans conquered Constantinople and turned the thick forests outside the Galata Walls into a ""Field of the Dead"", building up vast areas of the future Pera with granite monuments.
It was not until the sixteenth century that the first villas of local Greeks and Christians from neighboring Galata appeared on the site of the cemetery.
Initially, the descendants of major Greek merchants, bankers and moneylenders moved to Peru, for which the Turks often called the new area Beyoglu, which in Russian means ""son of the lord"".
Later, the local Greeks were joined by European merchants and ambassadors, which made it one of the most respectable districts of Istanbul.
However, despite the venerable public, the streets on the hillside were incredibly narrow. Pedestrians, carriages, horses, and porters mingled here into a constant motley crowd.
The narrow, densely built Pera was badly damaged by a fire of one thousand eight hundred and thirty-one, after which it was rebuilt in the European traditions popular at the time.
Such a radical transformation made Pera one of the city's most fashionable and visited neighborhoods.
Luxurious passages, cabarets, casinos and theaters opened by foreigners beckoned the citizens of the south coast here. Turks squandered fortunes here in search of new entertainment.
Even though the name of this area has long ago disappeared from the maps of Istanbul, it continues to live in the memory of local residents and the names of some attractions, as referring to the area between the upper station of the tunnel and Taksim Square.
