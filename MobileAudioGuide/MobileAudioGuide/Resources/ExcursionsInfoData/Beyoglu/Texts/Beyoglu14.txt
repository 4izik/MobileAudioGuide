The luxurious Pera Palace Hotel is one of the landmarks of the modern Beyoglu district.
Its history began at the end of the nineteenth century after the respectable Orient Express train was launched into the capital of the Ottoman Empire. The expensive train could only a high-class European public, requiring an appropriate level of accommodation, could travel on the expensive train.
Since at that time there were no hotels of such level in Istanbul, the reigning sultan decided to build one.
To implement the idea they invited French-Turkish architect Alessandro Vollori, famous for his neoclassical buildings of the Archaeological Museum and the headquarters of the Ottoman Bank. Vollori skillfully combined European glamour with a colorful Oriental spirit, and it is not surprising that at the beginning of the last century he was he was a much sought-after architect.
The Pera Palace Hotel was no less technically advanced and luxurious. It was the first building in Turkey to have electricity, hot water in every room and an electric elevator.
The comfort and convenience of its rooms were highly valued by politicians and prominent artists. King Edward VIII, Alfred Hitchcock, Joseph Brodsky, Alexander Vertinsky, Ernest Hemingway and others stayed here.
The hotel guests will definitely be shown the number one hundred and one turned into a small museum, where Mustafa Kemal Ataturk lived, as well as number four hundred and eleven, in which Agatha Christie came up with the idea to write a detective story ""Murder on the Orient Express"".
