Taksim Maxemi is the name of the water distribution station and the adjacent tower at the junction of Istiklal Street and Taksim Square.
The construction of the long water basin and the adjacent fountain tower began during the reign of Sultan Ahmed III and was completed during the reign of Mahmud I in the year one thousand seven hundred and thirty two.
The station was intended to supply the adjacent European neighborhoods of the BeyoÄŸlu district with fresh water from the Belgrade forest. In many ways, it was the construction of the water distribution station that contributed to the rapid growth of the Pera district.
These days, there is no longer a need for such distribution stations. That's why the building was visibly renovated in the late noughties to house the official Museum of the Republic inside.
However, the municipality insisted on opening an art gallery inside the station. You can admire the paintings here even now. In the twenty-four halls of the gallery various thematic exhibitions are regularly organized.
