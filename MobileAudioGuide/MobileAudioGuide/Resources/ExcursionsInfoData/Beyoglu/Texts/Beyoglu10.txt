The monumental building with white columns, located at the intersection of Istiklal and Muyyet Streets, is called Narmanli Khan.
It was built in Greek baroque style in the first half of the nineteenth century as one of the buildings of the Embassy of the Russian Empire in Istanbul. It housed various consular services, as well as courthouses and prisons for Russian subjects.
Shortly after the revolution, the building became the property of the Narmanli family. For many years it served as a studio for the prominent Istanbul writers and artists, who called it Narmanli's dormitory.
In the nineties there were plans to turn the building into a hotel, but since an agreement could not be reached between the owners, the idea was shelved.
In February 2011, the Esen and Erkul families bought the complex. After a global restoration of the monument of architecture, there are several cafes, stores and a museum of illusions.
Interestingly, the courtyard of the complex has always been inhabited by a myriad of cats, for which for many years the locals called Narmanly Khan the Cat Passage.
