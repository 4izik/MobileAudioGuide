On the corner of Istiklal and Yeni Çarşı Street is the modern cultural center of Yapi Kredi Bank.
The bank itself is one of Turkey's four largest commercial institutions. The cultural center was built on Istiklal Street at its request to hold all kinds of exhibitions, concerts and cultural events.
Inside you can visit the Cermet Çifter Salon, which displays the works of prominent Turkish and foreign photographers; the gallery of the bank founder Kazim Tashkent, known for its exhibitions of classical and contemporary paintings; and the ethnographic museum of the head of the cultural center and concurrently a famous collector Vedat Nedim Tör.
The latter is rightfully considered one of the most interesting museums on the territory of the complex. There is a textile collection of fabrics and carpets from the seventeenth to the nineteenth centuries, rare archaeological finds, unique embroidery and samples of calligraphy, collections of rosaries and the Karagoz shadow puppets, as well as one of the largest collections of ancient coins in the world.
