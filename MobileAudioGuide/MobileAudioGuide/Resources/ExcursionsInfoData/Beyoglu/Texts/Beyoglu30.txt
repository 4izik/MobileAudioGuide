Taksim Square was founded in the 1930s on the site of an ancient Armenian cemetery, known since the time of Suleiman the Magnificent.
The open space, elegantly designed by French architect Henri Prost, was originally intended for military parades and recreation of citizens. However, along with festive events, Taksim has often become the center of national unrest and demonstrations.
The square gets its name from the word meaning ""separation"". It recalls the water distribution station that has been supplying the surrounding neighborhoods with drinking water since the beginning of the eighteenth century.
In the last years of the Ottoman Empire, Taksim became a major traffic junction. The Istiklal streetcar line ended here and there was also a large bus station.
The northeastern part of the square at the beginning of the last century there was the Halil Pasha Artillery Barracks which was later transformed into the city's first stadium. There is now a public park called Taksim-Gezi.
In addition to the Gezi Park, the square is surrounded these days by the Mustafa Kemal Ataturk Cultural Center, the modern mosque built by Recep Tayyep Erdoğan, and the monumental buildings of prestigious hotels and stores.
Thanks to its transport accessibility Taksim Square is always popular with residents and guests of Istanbul. Life here does not stop day or night.
