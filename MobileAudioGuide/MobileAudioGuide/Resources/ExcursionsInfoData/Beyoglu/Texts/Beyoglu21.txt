The baroque building with a clock and the inscription Cité de Péra is called the ""Flower Passage"" by the people of Istanbul.
It was erected in the seventies of the nineteenth century on the site of the Naum Brothers Theater, which was burned in a fire. The land from the ashes was bought by the famous Greek banker Khristaki Zografos-Efendi, who also allocated an impressive sum for the construction of the arcade Cité de Péra.
Despite such a popular French name, it did not catch on, and for years the building was called simply 'Passage Christaki'. After its opening, the building hosted twenty-four stores and eighteen luxurious apartments.
By the turn of the last century Khristaki Passage became almost the most elite trade center in the city. Istanbul's intellectuals came here for shopping.
After Russian immigrants settled in Pera quarter the shopping arcade was taken over by the Russian upper class.
Former baronesses and princesses sold small bunches of fresh and artificial flowers to survive in difficult conditions.
Over time the flower shops became so numerous that they decided to rename it ""Flower Passage"". But in the fifties the flower sellers moved closer to the Egyptian market. And their place was taken by small cafes and inexpensive pubs. Like other buildings on Istiklal Street, the arcade was virtually abandoned.
And only by the end of the century was it decided to return it to its former appearance. After the restoration, restaurants were placed inside, which are invariably popular with tourists.
