Two magnificent red brick buildings in the Venetian neo-Gothic style frame the entrance to the courtyard of St. Anthony of Padua.
The church, now owned by the Franciscan order, is the largest Catholic basilica in the city.
It was built in the early twentieth century, designed by Italian architect Giulio Mongeri. And it was the second temple on Istiklal Street. The first one had to be demolished at the beginning of the century after streetcar tracks were laid in its place.
The first building, which was originally intended to be rented out to the congregation to supplement the parish budget, was constructed along with the church and had two brick houses attached to it by a gallery.
There is a monument to Pope John XXIII at the entrance to the basilica. Prior to his election as pontiff, Angelo Giuseppe Roncalli served as Vatican ambassador to Istanbul and preached in this church for ten years.
Today, the Basilica of St. Anthony of Padua continues to fulfill its direct functions. Masses are held there mostly on weekends, and given the Given the multi-ethnic character of the neighborhood, masses are held in several European languages.
