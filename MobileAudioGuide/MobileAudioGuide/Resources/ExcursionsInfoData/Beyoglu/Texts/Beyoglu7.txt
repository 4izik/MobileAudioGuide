Galip-Dede street is considered one of the oldest and most respectable streets of the Galata district. It appeared on the maps of Constantinople during the Genoese period.
The street was named in honor of the eighteenth century Ottoman poet, Mevlevi Sheikh Halib Mehmed Esad' also known as Grandpa Halib. Moreover, the sheikh was given such a high spiritual title at the age of thirty.
Galib went down in history as one of the first Turkish literary figures to focus on human beings rather than Allah. His grave is still venerated in the abode of the whirling dervishes on this street.
Named after the poet, the street has long been famous for its bookshops. Nowadays, they are increasingly replaced by musical instrument stores, souvenir shops, and small cafes.
