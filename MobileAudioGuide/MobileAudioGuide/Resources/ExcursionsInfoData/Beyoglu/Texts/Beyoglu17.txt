One of the highlights of Istiklal Street is its red streetcar.
Retro tram often can be found on plates, postcards and magnets in local souvenir stores.
This is not surprising, since it was on the Grand Rue de Pera in one thousand eight hundred and seventy-one year was started the first streetcar line.
At first the carriages moved on a horse traction. Despite its sluggishness, the streetcar enjoyed extraordinary popularity. Only during its first year of operation it carried four and a half million passengers.
Forty years later the Istanbul horse-tram ceased to exist, as all the horses had been mobilized by the War Ministry to participate in the military operations in the Balkans. But a year later the trams were put back on the line, though already on electric traction.
In the 20th century, the streetcar was so popular that the length of city routes reached a hundred and thirty kilometers. But by the sixties the ancient trams had been superseded by the more comfortable and less noisy buses.
The new era in the history of the Istanbul streetcar began in the nineties of the last century, when they decided to run on a modest retro tram along the pedestrian Istiklal for the joy of tourists.
Modern Istanbulites, who often travel on the foot of the train, call it simply ""nostalgic"".
These days, the historic streetcar serves more as a tourist attraction than as a means of transportation. And during the season, you can stand in a long line waiting for boarding.
