Behind an arch decorated with Arabic script and a crescent moon is the territory of the Galata Mewlevi Monastery, also known as Galata Mewlevihane or Kulekapi Mewlevihane.
This was the city's first tekke (cloister) building, built for Sufi spinning dervishes in 1491. Unfortunately, nothing has survived from the original building to this day. It burned down in the middle of the eighteenth century, after which it was rebuilt.
Mevlevi dervishes entered the history thanks to their ritual dances, during which, with the help of special rotating movements, they went into a trance and united their bodies with the supreme mind.
Not surprisingly, the central room in the tekke was always the hall for ritual dances. In addition, there were dervishe rooms, rooms of the shoykh (abbot), and the library.
For centuries, the Galata Monastery of Mevlevi was one of the most famous music and literature centers in the city. Many famous Turkish poets, composers and calligraphers started their careers here.
But after the fall of the Ottoman Empire, the dervishes were forbidden to perform their religious rites. All tekkes on the territory of Istanbul were closed.
Today there is a museum of Turkish classical poetry inside the temple, with musical instruments, manuscripts and ritual objects of the dervishes of the Mevlevi order.
On weekends, dervish descendants perform excerpts of their famous whirling dance for foreign tourists. Despite the seeming strangeness of the action, this religious show is always extremely popular, so it is better to buy tickets in advance.
