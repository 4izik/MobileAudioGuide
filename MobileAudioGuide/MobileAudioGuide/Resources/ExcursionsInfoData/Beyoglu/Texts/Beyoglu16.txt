The Pera district is also famous for its art museums. The youngest of them since two thousand five years occupies the building of the former hotel ""Bristol"", built in Victorian style at the turn of the nineteenth-twentieth century.
Since the museum is too young, its collection cannot be called particularly outstanding. Its main place is occupied by Turkish paintings of the seventeenth-nineteenth centuries, reflecting the usual subjects of the Ottoman Empire: portraits of sultans and shehzades, life in the harem, military campaigns, and landscapes of the city blocks.
There is also the most expensive Turkish painting of Osman Hamdi Bey ""Turtle Tamer"", bought in the year two thousand four for three and a half million dollars.
In addition to paintings in the permanent exhibition there is a small exhibition of porcelain from KÃ¼tahya' as well as the Anatolian Collection of Weights and Measures.
The upper floors of the building are periodically occupied by temporary exhibitions. In addition to these, the museum halls hold lectures, seminars, film screenings on art and art workshops for young visitors.
