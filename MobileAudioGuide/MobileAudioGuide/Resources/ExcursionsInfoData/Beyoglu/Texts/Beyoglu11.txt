Behind a high fence decorated with a two-headed eagle, the building of the former embassy, now the Consulate General of the Russian Federation in Istanbul, is hidden in the depths of the courtyard.
The history of diplomatic relations between Russia and the Ottoman Empire began in the fifteenth century thanks to the decisive actions of Ivan the Third. However the first diplomatic mission on Turkish soil did not appear until three centuries later.
According to legend for the construction of the embassy Catherine the Second ordered to deliver to the city several ships of soil, so it is quite appropriate to say that the Russian Consulate even today stands on Russian soil.
The Consulate-General got its present appearance in the middle of the nineteenth century, when at the highest order of the Emperor from St. Petersburg the court architect, a native of Switzerland Gaspar Fossati, arrived in Istanbul. For his new diplomatic mission he chose the then popular Russian Classicist style.
The Europeans and Turks living nearby were so impressed by the perfection of the classical forms that Fossati was invited to build buildings for the Dutch, Swedish, Spanish and Iranian embassies as well as to reconstruct a number of Ottoman buildings, including the Hagia Sophia converted into a mosque.
In general, the ""St. Petersburg Swiss"" who came to Istanbul for a single order had to stay in the capital of the Ottoman Empire for twenty years.
Like a century and a half ago, today the Consulate General retains the inherent magnificence of tsarist Russia. The St. Petersburg hall of the palace, the ceiling of which is painted with views of the city on the Neva, is particularly impressive.
