After a short walk from Istiklal along Meselik Lane, you can find yourself in the cozy courtyard of the Church of the Holy Trinity.
The church belongs to the Greek community of the Orthodox Church of Constantinople and is the largest active Orthodox structure in Istanbul.
The Church of the Holy Trinity was erected at the end of the nineteenth century on the site of the wooden church of St. George, the adjoining cemetery and the hospital. The project for the future shrine was designed by Greek architect Kampanaki, who chose Neo-Baroque style with elements of Byzantine and Romanesque architecture.
It is interesting that the structure was the first Christian temple in the Ottoman Empire, in the architecture of which the main role played by the dome. Until the end of the nineteenth century, only mosques could be domed, but not the religious buildings of other world religions.
The rich interior of the church is decorated with graceful frescos, stained-glass windows and marble carvings. Of particular interest are the Baroque Gospel pulpit and several Byzantine icons.
At the beginning of the last century, the Church of the Holy Trinity was actively visited by Russian emigrants Pera and Galata. Nowadays, Istanbul Greeks pray here more often, but the doors of the church are still open to Orthodox Christians from other countries, including Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus.
