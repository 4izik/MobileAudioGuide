In the immediate vicinity of Mevlevi Monastery, Galip Dede flows smoothly into Istiklal Street.
Istiklal, or simply Independence Street, is considered the main pedestrian street of Istanbul. Despite its name, which it received after the fall of the Ottoman Empire, the history of the street goes back several centuries.
At the time when the Genoans owned Galata, the southern tip of the future Istiklal Street was occupied by a city gate with a dense forest behind it.
But during the reign of Suleiman the Magnificent the area near the gate was fancied by small traders and craftsmen. At that time, it was the only street in the area, which bore the honorary name of Main Avenue (Jadde-i Kebir).
Not one hundred years passed before the street was inhabited by Europeans. Among the Muslim buildings grew like mushrooms after the rain foreign embassies and churches of all kinds of Christian denominations.
By the nineteenth century, Main Avenue was more like the luxury avenues of Paris and Vienna. It was not for nothing that the Turks, who were addicted to all things French, even renamed it Grand'rue de Pera. And by the end of the century it was the most respectable and technically equipped street, at the foot of which the funicular ascended, and along the way the first city streetcar ran.
After the fall of the Ottoman Empire, Istiklal Street fully justified its name. It was it that turned out to be the center of mass pogroms and protests in the middle of the last century. It was Beyoglu's central street turned into ruins for several decades and only in the nineties of the last century it managed to restore its former respectable appearance.
Today the Istanbul Arbat is the center of entertainment and shopping. It's a particularly pleasant place to stroll in the evening when the windows are illuminated and the pedestrian area is flooded with musicians and street performers.
