Sahne Alley, where nowadays the famous Galatasaray Fish Market is located, separates the entrances to the Flower Passage and the European Passage.
The entrance arch of the latter is noticeably lost against the background of the primitive sweets and fruits shops, but inside you can fully experience why the European Passage is considered the most elegant shopping pavilion in Istanbul.
Like its neighbor, it was built at the end of the nineteenth century to a design by Dominique Pulcher. The architect decided to repeat in his brainchild the interiors of the popular Parisian arcade Choiselle.
It turned out not bad. Lavish decoration with marble, Corinthian columns and sculptures gives a sense of European chic and glamour, and for the abundance of mirrors this shopping complex is often called the 'Mirror Passage'.
Initially, it was one of the city's most expensive malls. The best hairdressers, jewelers, watchmakers, shoemakers, as well as stores of musical instruments, flowers, fabrics, shoes and other essential goods worked within its walls.
After the reconstruction at the end of the last century, the European passage was occupied by souvenir dealers, where you can find literally everything on sale. From chess to olive soap, and from unusual antiques to copies of jewelry from TV series The Magnificent Century.
