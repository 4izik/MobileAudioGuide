In the autumn of 1920, after the fall of Wrangel's army, Istanbul was flooded by thousands of Russian emigrants. Fleeing the civil war, they used the city as a staging ground on their way to Europe. Nevertheless, during the few years they lived here, the Russian White Guards had a tremendous impact on Turkish culture.
It is not known exactly how many refugees from Russia arrived on Turkish shores. According to conservative estimates, there were about one hundred fifty to two hundred thousand of them.
At first they all flocked to the embassy building on Grand'rue de Pera, which in those years served as a dormitory, hospital, warehouse and information desk, subsequently settling in the adjoining quarters of Galata and Pera.
The most enterprising opened small businesses, restaurants, bakeries, pastry stores, stores, pharmacies, cabarets, and the offices of lawyers and doctors' offices. Former officers and colonels did not shy away from moonlighting as mechanics and cab drivers. 
The rest worked as anything they could find: dock porters, washerwomen, waiters, peddlers of all sorts of nonsense, including their own clothes, and even opened a chiromancy parlor and a Theater of Live Pornographic Pictures at Pere.
Former baronesses and princesses, in order not to sink to the level of street girls, sold artificial flowers, as and also worked as dishwashers, checkroom attendants and usherettes in the entertainment establishments of the city.
There were also many creative people among the emigrants. Thus, Alexander Vertinsky's performances were a constant success with the local public, and thanks to Lidia Arzumanova the first ballet school was opened in Turkey.
Russian women especially delighted the local men. Blue-eyed Slavic women with shining manners and excellent taste literally drove them crazy.
History is silent about how many Turkish families were broken up in those years. Clearly, quite a few, since the Turkish women quite officially demanded that the authorities deport the Russian women. However, this did not prevent them from adopting the Russian beauties' fashion for short haircuts.
Most of the emigrants left Istanbul four years later. Nevertheless, despite all the hardships of life here, many of the Russian refugees retained fond memories of Istanbul and its inhabitants to the end of their days.
