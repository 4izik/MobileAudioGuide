A mint has been located in the southwestern part of Alai Meydana since the first half of the eighteenth century. It was moved closer to the sultan's residence thanks to the petitions of the Grand Vizier Ahmed III in Ibrahim Pasha.
It acquired its modern appearance about a century later, when the ruling Sultan Abdul-Majid attached several new premises to the building and equipped them with the latest technology.
For more than a century, the Mint not only minted coins and issued banknotes, but also formed the location of court jewelers- cutters, goldsmiths and cabinetmakers.
The products they created were used to decorate the interiors of Topkapi, and were also given as a sultan's favor to beloved wives and distinguished government officials.
In the second half of the twentieth century, the Mint moved to another area. The most valuable old machines became exhibits of the Archaeological Museum, while others continued to rust in the walls of an abandoned building. And it was only in nineteen ninety-six that the Historical Foundation undertook the restoration of this monument of architecture and history.
Nowadays, part of the Mint's premises are occupied by restoration workshops, and part is used for music festivals and exhibitions.
