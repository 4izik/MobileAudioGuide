The main gate leading to the Topkapi Palace, for its location on the top of the hill, was named Bab-y-Humayun or the Highest. Often they are also called Imperial or Sultan, since it was through them that the ruler left the palace.
At such moments, a cannon salvo was heard on the territory of the residence, which is why the whole complex was called Topkapi or "The Palace at the Cannon Gate".
Bab-y-Humayun was built in the time of Mehmed the Conqueror, but later Mahmud II and Abdul-Aziz organized their restoration. From the documents of the fifteenth century it is known that earlier a pavilion with a tower was installed above the gate, and in the recesses on the sides the heads of unknown criminals were exposed for public viewing.
The tower has not been preserved to this day. In addition to niches resembling mitres in shape, the gate is decorated with a plate with a gilded saying "Allah will make the glory of the builder eternal; Allah will make his creation durable; Allah will strengthen its foundations."
During the empire, at any time of the day or night, the gates were guarded by a special guard of 50 janissaries, which was called kapij. These days they have been replaced by ordinary law enforcement officers.
