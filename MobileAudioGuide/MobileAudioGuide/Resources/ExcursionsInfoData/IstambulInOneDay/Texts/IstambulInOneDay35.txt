The small Firuz-Agha Mosque pales noticeably against the background of its monumental neighbors. Nevertheless, it is considered one of the oldest in the city.
A square mosque with a single minaret was erected in one thousand four hundred and ninety-one with the money of the chief treasurer Bayezid II in Firuz-Agi. In its architectural style, this structure resembles the classic Ottoman mosques of Iznik and Bursa. The carved door hides modest interiors decorated with elegant calligraphy and stained glass windows.
Until the nineteenth century, there was a cemetery and the mausoleum of Firuz-Aga on the territory of the mosque, which were demolished during the expansion of Divan-Yolu Street.
They say that the chief treasurer of Bayezid II chose his burial place for a reason. Even in Byzantine times, a mighty oak tree grew on the territory of the future mosque. It was near him that Firuz-Agha wished to establish his mausoleum.
Nowadays, the remains of the official were moved closer to the minaret, and a small courtyard with a garden was laid out on the site of the former burial to open a view of the Blue Mosque.
