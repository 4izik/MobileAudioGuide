In the northern part of the former Hippodrome, not far from the place where the quadriga was taken to Venice by the Crusaders, a German fountain was installed at the beginning of the last century.
The elegant rotunda in the neo-Byzantine style was presented as a gift to the ruling Sultan Abdul Hamid II and the German Kaiser Wilhelm II, as a sign of friendship and strengthening of the alliance between the two states.
Wilhelm planned to get the Sultan to sign an agreement on the beginning of the construction of the Baghdad railway. But Abdul-Hamid was in no hurry to answer, believing that geologists searching for oil deposits were arriving in the empire under the guise of archaeologists.
Nevertheless, the gift appeased the ruler, and the Germans were allowed to begin construction.
