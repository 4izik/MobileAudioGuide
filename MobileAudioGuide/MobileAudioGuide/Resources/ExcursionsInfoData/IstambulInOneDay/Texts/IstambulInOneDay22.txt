In the southwestern part of the Augusteion, near the walls of the Grand Imperial Palace, Constantine the Great erected the so-called Milion or Milium - a pillar from which all roads of the Byzantine Empire were counted.
Once it was a double triumphal arch with a pyramidal gilded roof. To this day, only a small stump of a column has survived from that majestic structure, transferred to the archaeological excavation area next to the Basilica cistern.
Inside the arch was the pillar itself with the distances to important cities marked on it, as well as statues of Emperor Constantine and his mother Elena. The latter held a cross in her hands, in which the Fate of the city was kept - a charmed chain that gives victory over enemies.
Justinian decorated the roof of the Milion with a gnomon in the form of a soaring gilded angel. By its shadow, the Byzantines determined the time on a sunny day.
Subsequent rulers repeatedly changed the monuments inside the structure. In the first half of the eighth century, the image of the arch was decorated with bas-reliefs from Ecumenical Cathedrals, and in the era of iconoclasm they were replaced by scenes from the Hippodrome.
Periodically, the heads of executed criminals were hung on the Milion. However, the Byzantines practiced this much less often than the Ottomans.
The Crusaders who came to Constantinople in the eighth century melted down the gilded angel into coins, and the Ottomans in the sixteenth century leveled the monument to the ground. The remains of the arch were accidentally discovered as a result of excavations in the middle of the last century.
Nowadays, the Milium fades under the shadow of a water tower erected next door in the sixteenth century.
