Not everyone will pay attention to the Corinthian column installed among the trees in the northeastern part of Gulhane Park. Nevertheless, this column is considered one of the oldest Roman monuments in Istanbul.
Even in ancient Byzantium, this cape was decorated with a majestic Acropolis and Forum, which served as the center of the social, religious and political life of the city.
It is not surprising that it was here that the triumphal column was installed, which perpetuated the memory of the victory of the Romans over the Goths. This can be judged by the Latin inscription "With the victory over the Goths, fortune has returned to us."
However, it is not known exactly when this column was erected. According to one version, she glorified the victories of Claudius II of Gotha, according to another - Constantine the Great himself, since both rulers at one time conducted campaigns against the Goths.
It is only known for sure that it was built no later than the fourth century.
At the end of the last century, archaeologists managed to find another, much older one under the Latin inscription, the text of which, unfortunately, could not be disassembled. So there was a version that the column could have been installed by the Athenians as a sign of a triumphant victory over the Thracian tribes.
