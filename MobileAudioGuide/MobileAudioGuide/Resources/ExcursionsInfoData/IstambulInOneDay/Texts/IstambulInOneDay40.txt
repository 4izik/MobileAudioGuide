The vast religious complex or kullye on Janissary Street, built by the disciple of the great Mimar Sinan Davut-Aga from chopped stone, is considered one of the best examples of Ottoman architecture of the nineteenth century. It was built in one thousand five hundred and ninety-three with the money of Koja Sinan Pasha.
The fate of this venerable gentleman is full of dramatic events. He was born into an Albanian Christian family and, among others, as a child, he got into the Ottoman Enderun school at the Topkapi Palace, where future servants of the sultan were trained.
After graduating from the institution during the reign of Suleiman the Magnificent, Koja Sinan was appointed head of the kitchen. However, after the death of the Sultan, thanks to the courage shown by him in the conquest of Yemen and Tunisia, he rose to the post of Grand Vizier of the Ottoman Empire. Moreover, he held this position as many as five times: under Selim II, Murad III, and Mehmed III.
Having overcome a series of ups and downs, Koja Sinan Pasha made a brilliant career and became the richest and most respected of all the viziers of the Ottoman Empire that ever existed.
The cullier built by him according to the canons of Islam was a charitable organization. Initially, a madrasah, a public fountain and a mausoleum of the Grand Vizier were erected here. And two hundred years later, the vast territory of the complex was also transformed into a cemetery.
