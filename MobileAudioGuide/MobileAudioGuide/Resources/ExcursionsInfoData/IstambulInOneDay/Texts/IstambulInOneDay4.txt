The Bosphorus Strait, which connects the Black and Marmara Seas on the border of Europe and Asia, is no less legendary than the neighboring Golden Horn Bay.
Translated from ancient Greek, the Bosphorus means ""cow ford"". The myth of the daughter of the ancestor of the Argos kings Inakh is hidden in this name.
The loving Zeus fell in love with the beautiful Io, but his wife Hera decided to take revenge on the offender. To save his beloved from the wrath of the goddess, Zeus turned Io into a cow.
However, Hera recognized her husband's beloved in her beautiful eyes. For many years she kept Io locked up until Hermes killed the giant Argus guarding her. Then the jealous goddess set a huge gadfly on Io, from which the dumb cow had to flee across the strait to the countries of Asia.
For centuries, the Bosphorus has played an important role in shipping, as it was the only way for ships traveling from the Black Sea to the Mediterranean.
The benefits of building a port on its shores were appreciated by the ancient Greeks. They were the first to start collecting tribute from passing ships.
However, both Byzantium and Constantinople grew only within the city walls. For many years, the shores of the Bosphorus were covered with wild forests, and only in the fifteenth century Suleiman the Magnificent allowed the nobility to build the first mosques and summer palaces on the Asian coast.
After the First World War, this narrow winding strait became a neutral zone controlled by the League of Nations. Now it is open to all countries of the world, but Turkey has the right to restrict the passage of military vessels and ships of countries outside the Black Sea zone through it.
