The octagonal marble building on the right side of Divan-Yolu Street is the mausoleum of the Ottoman Sultan Mahmud II, whose reign fell at the beginning of the nineteenth century. Mahmud II went down in history as the initiator of an extensive program of reforms of political and public life on the Western model.
It is not surprising that the mausoleum was designed for him in the Empire style under the influence of Western architecture.
The ashes of the sultan rested within its walls in one thousand eight hundred and fortieth year. Later, the tombs of Mahmud II's son and grandson appeared nearby: Abdul-Aziz and Abdul-Hamid II. A small cemetery has been opened next to them, where numerous relatives of the sultan, as well as several prominent Ottoman politicians, poets and writers are buried.
