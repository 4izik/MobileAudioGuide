Behind a low arched fence decorated with lattices, through which the tombstones are clearly visible, another cullier hides.
This complex was built at the beginning of the eighteenth century at the expense of the Grand Vizier Sultan Ahmed III Chorlulu Damat Ali Pasha. It includes a small mosque with one minaret, a fountain for ablutions, a library, a madrasah and other buildings.
Nowadays, the former religious school has been occupied by carpet shops, souvenir shops and cafes. Actually, it is for the sake of the cafe that it is worth a look here. After all, this is the most authentic hookah garden in the city.
Here you can relax from the hustle and bustle of the city, drink a cup of tea or Turkish coffee and slowly smoke a hookah, as do the locals and students of the neighboring university.
