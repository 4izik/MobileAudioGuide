The vast green Gulhane Park, which occupies an impressive part of Cape Sarayburnu, is the oldest and one of the largest public parks in Istanbul.
It appeared on the map of the city after the capture of Constantinople by the Ottoman Empire and the construction of the sultan's Topkapi Palace. For many years, this area remained closed to visitors. Only the sultan and his entourage could walk behind the high walls.
The park got its name Gulhane or "House of Roses" due to the abundance of flowers. According to legend, the first rose bush was planted here by Mehmed II in the one thousand four hundred and sixties.
In one thousand eight hundred and thirty-nine, the park was at the center of political events. Then, on its territory, the Grand Vizier Mustafa Reshid Pasha announced the Gulhaney Act, which marked the beginning of large-scale social reforms. This document became a kind of Constitution of the empire, recognizing the equality of all subjects regardless of their religion and position in society.
And just a couple of decades later, a fire broke out in the park, destroying most of its wooden buildings. They decided not to restore what was lost. Having cleared the rubble and improved the territory, in nineteen hundred and twelve the park was opened to the general public.
Another large-scale restoration occurred at the beginning of the two thousandth. Since then, Gulhane pleases visitors with even more flowers and green spaces.
