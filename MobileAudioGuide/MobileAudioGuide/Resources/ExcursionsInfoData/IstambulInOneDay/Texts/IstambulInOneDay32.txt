The last of the obelisks appeared at the Constantinople Hippodrome thanks to the efforts of Theodosius in the three hundred and ninetieth year.
It is a four-sided monolith of pink granite, and because of the hieroglyphs adorning it, the obelisk of Theodosius is often called Egyptian.
Initially, it was part of the great temple of Amun-Ra in Thebes, and it was erected in one thousand four hundred and sixty before our era by Pharaoh Thutmose III as a symbol of his glorious victories.
At first, the obelisk was about twice as tall, reaching thirty-seven meters in height.
Unfortunately, as a result of transportation, the column split into two parts. As a result, only one of them was installed at the Racetrack, with a total height of about twenty meters.
A pedestal made in the Byzantine era and decorated with bas-reliefs depicting scenes from the life of Emperor Theodosius and circus performances adds about seven meters to the height of the obelisk.
Despite numerous fires, wars and earthquakes, the obelisk has been perfectly preserved. Even now it looks as if it came out from under the master's hand only yesterday. The Turks treat the Egyptian treasure with special warmth and love, considering it a talisman of their rule over Istanbul.
