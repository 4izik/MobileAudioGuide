The gates of Greetings, connecting the first and second courtyards of the complex, clearly stand out against the background of the powerful walls.
Despite the fact that this entrance was built in the time of Mehmed the Conqueror, its modern appearance with two octagonal towers was formed only during the global restructuring of Suleiman the Magnificent.
During the empire, there was a permanent guard of a special detachment of janissaries, who also monitored the observance of silence in the first courtyard.
The Vizier and foreign ambassadors had the right to enter the first courtyard on horseback, but only the sultan and his mother could cross the gate of Greetings on horseback.
There were two small rooms inside the gate. On the right, visitors and foreign ambassadors were waiting for an audience, on the left was the entrance to the underground prison, the gatekeepers' room, as well as the living room of the chief executioner.
Nowadays, there is an information bureau and an entrance ticket control service for those who want to explore the palace.
