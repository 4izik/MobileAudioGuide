The square in front of St. Sophia Cathedral was called the Augusteion during the Byzantine Empire.
It was laid under Constantine the Great and named after his mother, Augusta Elena. In its shape it resembled a regular quadrangle surrounded by columns and porticos. In the center was a porphyry column with a statue of St. Helena, and around it were columns in honor of Constantine and his three sons.
After the devastating uprising of ""Nick"", Justinian noticeably renewed the Augusteion. Five ancient columns were replaced by one, on top of which the emperor himself sat on a horse.
The most beautiful public buildings and palaces of Constantinople were located around the square: the Zeuxippus bathhouse, the library, the Patriarch's chambers, the house of the ruler of the city, the palaces of prominent dignitariesâ€¦
On the east side was the magnificent Senate building, noticeably rebuilt after the fire of five hundred and thirty-two. Historians suggest that this palace was later called the Magnavra Palace and was used for the monarch's addresses to the townspeople and audiences with ambassadors.
