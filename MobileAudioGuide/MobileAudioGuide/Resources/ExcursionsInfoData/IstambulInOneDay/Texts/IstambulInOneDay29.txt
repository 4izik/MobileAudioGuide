The Hippodrome adjoined the western walls of the Grand Imperial Palace in Byzantine times.
This grandiose structure, in its structure resembling the Circus Maximus in Rome, was conceived to be built by Septimius Severus in the two hundred and third year. However, it was completed only by Constantine the Great in the three hundred and thirtieth. Then the grandiose chariot races marked the birth of the new capital of the Roman Empire.
Since its construction, the Hippodrome has been one of the main buildings of Constantinople.
Not only horse races were organized here, but also landmark city events were held: they exhibited war trophies and captured tsars, staged parades, festive performances and even public executions.
In its heyday, the Racetrack could accommodate up to a hundred thousand people. A separate box was built for the emperor and his entourage on the eastern tribune, which was connected by a passage with the Great Imperial Palace. This allowed the sovereign to easily withdraw from the competitions, which sometimes lasted all day.
Interest in the Hippodrome began to fade gradually from the eleventh century, after the emperors left the Grand Palace.
The crusaders who crushed Constantinople in the year one thousand two hundred and fourth also caused huge damage to the arena. As a war trophy, they took to Venice a quadriga of gilded bronze that decorated the main entrance to the Hippodrome. It is curious that it still exists today, as an element of the decor of Saint Mark's Cathedral.
The destroyed arena was never restored again, and over time the stands were completely pulled apart for building materials.
Nowadays, the grandiose building of antiquity has turned into one of the parts of the central square of Istanbul - Sultanahmet.
