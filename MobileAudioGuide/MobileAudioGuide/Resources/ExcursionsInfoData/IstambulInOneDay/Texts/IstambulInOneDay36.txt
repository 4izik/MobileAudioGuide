In Byzantine times, this street was called Mesa, which meant ""average"". It ran through the whole city from east to west, connecting the main city squares, and no money was spared for its decoration.
Literally from the moment of construction, the Mesa was laid out with stone slabs and surrounded by porticos, saving passers-by from the sun and rain. It was under the porticos that jubilant crowds of citizens gathered to greet the emperor who returned to the city or to take part in a solemn procession.
By the way, the processions took place on the Mesa with enviable regularity. In addition, the porticos were so wide that the solemn procession could well not go out in the rain during its movement.
So much delicious place very quickly fell in love with merchants.
Jewelers, sellers of silk and gold-woven fabrics, as well as all kinds of luxury items were located closer to the center. A little further there was a grain market and a small alley where slaves were sold.
Nowadays, the Sofa-Iola is also actively used by merchants, although now the trading places on it are mostly occupied by souvenir shops.
