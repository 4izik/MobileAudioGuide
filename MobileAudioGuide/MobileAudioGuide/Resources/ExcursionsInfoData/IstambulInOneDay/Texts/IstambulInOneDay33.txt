Next to the obelisk of Theodosius today stands a monumental stone building, presumably built on the site of the Byzantine Hippodrome at the end of the fifteenth century.
With the coming to power of Suleiman the Magnificent, the sultan ordered his court architect Mimar Sinan to adapt this building for housing.
It turned out quite unconventional. The building was rebuilt in stone, while most of the buildings in the sixteenth century used wood as the main material. Such a reception allowed the palace to survive almost unchanged to the present day.
Suleiman the Magnificent presented this residence as a wedding gift to his faithful Vizier Ibrahim Pasha. The Grand Vizier lived in his ""fortress"" until one thousand five hundred and thirty-sixth year, until he was strangled as ""having lost confidence"".
After his death, all the property passed to the state. Successive sultans on the throne, every now and then instilled new viziers into the residence, each of whom sought, albeit slightly, to change the appearance of his palace. However, the building was not only residential. For a while there was an embassy, a garment factory and even a prison.
In one thousand nine hundred and thirty-eighth year, the ancient architectural monument opened its doors as a museum of Turkish and Islamic art, in the collection of which forty thousand exhibits dated from the seventh to the nineteenth centuries are dated.
The seven departments of the museum exhibit unique collections of ceramics, glass, wood, stone, metal products, historical documents, jewelry, clothing, furniture, as well as one of the most impressive collections of carpets in the world.
