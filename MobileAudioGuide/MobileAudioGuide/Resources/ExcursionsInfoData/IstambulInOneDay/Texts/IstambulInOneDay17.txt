On the square in front of the entrance to the Topkapi Palace stands a small structure similar to a small palace.
In fact, it is a fountain recognized as one of the most beautiful and original in Istanbul. It was built in one thousand seven hundred and twenty-eighth year on the instructions of Ahmed III on the site where the city fountain Perayton was located in Byzantine times.
Despite the name, it is difficult to recognize a fountain in the usual sense of the word in the structure. This is a covered building, in the center of which there is a swimming pool, and outside on the sides there are four drinking fountains.
For many years, the presence of its own water source in Istanbul was considered only the lot of the elect, the majority of the population received water from the city fountains.
Ahmed III did not know that Allah is kind to those who donate part of their fortune to support those in need. Thus, the construction of the fountain at his expense is a kind of sign of nobility, an attempt to get closer to the people and imprint his name for centuries.
By the way, the Sultan succeeded. On the four sides of the fountain there are plaques with poems praising the water and the benefactor. You need to read them clockwise, starting from the north.
The generosity of the ruler is also evidenced by the fact that during religious holidays, not only water was distributed free of charge at this fountain, but also sorbet with fruit juice.
It is not surprising that the significance of this structure for the Turks is so great that for several years in the middle of the last century it was depicted on a ten-lira bill.
