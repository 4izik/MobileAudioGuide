Snake column, much older than the neighboring obelisk of Constantine. It was cast from the spoils of war that the Greeks inherited after the victory over the Persians at Plataea in the four hundred and seventy-ninth year before our era.
Initially, this column was a sacrificial tripod for the temple of Apollo in Delphi, and its top was crowned with three intertwined heads of snakes holding a three-meter golden vase.
The Snake Column came to Constantinople under Constantine the Great, and the locals immediately endowed it with magical power.
Legends say that the city suffered from a huge number of snakes. But it was only necessary to install this column on the Hippodrome, as all the snakes crawled away outside the city walls. If someone still managed to be bitten by a snake, then the column, according to legend, gave healing.
The golden bowl of the Snake Column disappeared in ancient times, but several legends are associated with the loss of snake heads.
The first one says that Mehmed the Conqueror cut off the monster's heads with his scimitar. Allegedly, by such an act he decided to protect his subjects from witchcraft.
This is quite hard to believe, since Mehmed II was a devoted connoisseur of art. In addition, the integrity of the column was mentioned in descriptions and drawings of a much later time.
Perhaps one of the heads disappeared during the time of Mehmed's followers, as there was a rumor around the city that the Greeks had hidden untold treasures inside the column. Another version says that they were beaten off drunk by some Polish aristocrat at the beginning of the eighteenth century.
Fortunately, two heads were still preserved. One became an exhibit of the Archaeological Museum of Istanbul, and the second was taken to the British Museum.
