To the north of Bayezid Square, the monumental entrance to Istanbul University attracts the eye.
Once upon a time, the first palace of Mehmed II stood on its territory. Together with his residence, the Sultan founded a religious school, which later became the basis for the development of the university. This happened in one thousand four hundred and fifty-third year, which makes the educational institution one of the oldest in Europe.
The university began its history as two theological schools, where astronomy, philosophy, geography, literature and languages were studied. But by the one thousand eight hundred and forty-sixth year, these schools were united under the common name ""House of Sciences"". At the same time, departments of applied physics, law, literature, mathematics and theology appeared here.
At the beginning of the twentieth century, the ""House of Sciences"" was expanded to the ""House of Multiple Sciences"" and the curricula were significantly modernized, and in nineteen thirty-three, the educational institution received the official status of Istanbul University.
Nowadays, it is the leading university in Turkey and is included in the list of five hundred best universities in the world, and more than eighty thousand students receive education here.
