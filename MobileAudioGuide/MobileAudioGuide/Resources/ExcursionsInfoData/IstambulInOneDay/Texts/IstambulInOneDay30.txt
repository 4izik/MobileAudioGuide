Only some elements of the ""back"" - the structure in the center of the arena, which the charioteers had to go around during the competition, have survived from the Racetrack to the present time.
And the first of them is the dilapidated obelisk of Constantine, soaring into the sky in the southern part of the square.
Most likely, it was installed at the dawn of the existence of the Byzantine Empire. However, no one will remember what it was like then, since in the nineteen-fortieth year, Emperor Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus noticeably rebuilt this column.
He decorated it with bronze, gilded plates with bas-reliefs depicting the exploits of his grandfather Basil the Macedonian.
The top of the column was crowned with a ball, on top of which was a weather vane in the form of a female figure. Popularly, the Golden Column was often called ""the servant of the wind"" and ""a miracle equal to the Colossus of Rhodes.""
The Crusaders, sweeping away everything in their path, did not spare the expensive decoration of the Golden Column: the bas-reliefs that decorated it were melted down into coins.
No less damage to the column of Constantine was inflicted by young janissaries who climbed to the top, proving their skills.
Over the thousand-year history of its existence, the obelisk of Constantine has become shorter by eleven meters. Nowadays, the height of the structure is twenty-one meters.
