Where the Augusteion and the giant Hippodrome complex were located in Byzantine times, the impressive Sultanahmet Square is now broken up.
This open space, like the entire surrounding area, got its name in honor of the mosque of the same name, which adorns it from the southwest side.
In fact, modern Sultanahmet consists of two parts. The first of them is located between the Blue Mosque and the Hagia Sophia. On the eastern side it is bounded by the baths of Roksolana, and in the center there is one of the largest fountains in the city.
The second part occupies the territory of the former Racetrack. Several very curious Byzantine monuments have been preserved here, as well as the palace of Ibrahim Pasha built in the sixteenth century.
We will tell you more about each of these objects in the following points of the audio tour.
