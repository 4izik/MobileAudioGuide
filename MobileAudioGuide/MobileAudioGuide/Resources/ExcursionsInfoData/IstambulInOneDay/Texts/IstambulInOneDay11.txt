At the exit from Gulhane Park, the Istanbul Archaeological Museum is located in the first courtyard of the Topkapi Palace.
Its history began at the end of the nineteenth century, when a peasant accidentally discovered ancient tombs near ancient Sidon. As a result of the excavations that began, a whole underground necropolis was discovered, in two caves of which several perfectly preserved sarcophagi from Antiquity were found.
Archaeological exhibits were previously housed in the Topkapi Palace, but by the end of the nineteenth century the collection had grown so much that the question of erecting a separate building was raised.
Nowadays, the museum's collection contains several million exhibits from all over the former Ottoman Empire. Of these, only about a thousand are on public display.
The most valuable are the Sidonian sarcophagi from the royal tomb, including those depicting scenes from the life of Alexander the Great; the only surviving statue of a lion from the Mausoleum in Halicarnassus; the richest collection of cuneiform tablets of Mesopotamia; a huge bas-relief depicting the Hittite king Varpalavas from the eighth century before our era; bas-reliefs with images of lions that decorated the main street of Babylon in the era of The reign of Nebuchadnezzar II; and also the very first written peace treaty in the history of mankind between the Egyptians and the Hittites, signed in one thousand two hundred and fifty-eighth before our era.
There are also archaeological artifacts from Troy, ancient cities of Asia Minor, the Arabian Peninsula, Egypt and Mesopotamia, all kinds of statues, ceramics, as well as a rich collection of Ottoman coins, seals, orders and medals.
In a separate building, known as the Museum of the Ancient East, an extensive collection of Sumerian-Akkadian and Assyrian art is exhibited, and in the Tiled Pavilion, which is now considered part of the archaeological museum, a collection of ceramics and tiles.
