To the north of the Grand Bazaar and to the east of the Suleymaniye Mosque, numerous handicraft workshops and trading shops cling to each other down the slope of the hill leading to the Golden Horn Bay.
For the most part, they occupy the territory of former khans, which were built as hotels-warehouses for merchant caravans.
Nowadays, this area, built on the foundations of inns of Byzantine times, makes a depressing impression. Nevertheless, it is here that you can feel the true exoticism of the colorful and diverse Istanbul.
One of the largest khans of the city is considered to be Buyuk Walide Sultan Khan. It was built in the middle of the seventeenth century by the order of Kesem Sultan - Haseki Ahmed I and the mother of Murad IV and Ibrahim I. At the time of construction, Kesem was already the grandmother of the ruling Mehmed IV, who, because of which the khan of her name was called ""The Khan of the Sultan's grandmother"".
The money from this construction went to the maintenance of the mosque of Chinili, built on the instructions of Kesem Sultan in the Uskyudar district. The complex was run by Shiite dervishes, who erected a small mosque on its territory to perform religious rites.
The two-storey khan combined three courtyards. At the same time, the Western one existed here even during the Byzantine Empire. It was here in one thousand five hundred and sixty-seventh that the first Istanbul printing house was opened.
Nowadays, the western courtyard is practically abandoned. Only a high square tower has been preserved, where, according to legend, Kesem's personal treasures were hidden. But the northern and southern courtyards are still used by hardworking descendants of Shiite dervishes.
On the opposite side of Chakmakcylar Street, the Buyuk Yeni Khan (Large), built in the second half of the eighteenth century for Mustafa III, is also well preserved. Now they sell textiles and silverware here.
