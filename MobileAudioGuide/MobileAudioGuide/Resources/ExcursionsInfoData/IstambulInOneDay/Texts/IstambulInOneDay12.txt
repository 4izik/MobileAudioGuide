Topkapi Palace is a sequential system of four courtyards.
The first, the most extensive, was accessible to all citizens, the second was the working residence of the sultan, where only elected senior officials and ambassadors could get in, and the third and fourth housed the personal chambers of the sovereign and his harem.
Nowadays, anyone can also get into the first courtyard absolutely free of charge, but to see the rest you will have to buy a separate ticket.
This courtyard was called Alai Meydany or Parade Square, and it often became the arena for various palace ceremonies. Ambassadors and important guests were waiting for an audience with the Sultan at the entrance to the second courtyard, and the heads of executed high-ranking criminals were put on public display here.
Among the people, Alai Meydans were often also called the court of Janissaries. It was here, under the infamous sycamore tree, that the sultan's soldiers expressed their dissatisfaction, demanding the head of the next pasha. The wishes of the rebels were not always satisfied, and instead of the vizier's head, the yard was often decorated with the bodies of janissaries hung on a tree.
Several important buildings were erected around the perimeter of the square. So, on the side of the Marmara Sea, there was previously a hospital for pages and janissaries, a sultan's bakery and a palace water supply service.
Opposite stood the Church of St. Irene, converted by the Ottomans into an Arsenal, and the Mint, behind which lived numerous employees of the palace. There was also an octagonal tower of correct papers, where commoners were helped to draw up petitions and petitions to the state Sofa according to all requirements.
Despite the fact that life has always been in full swing in the first courtyard of the Topkapi Palace, almost all the time there was a deathly silence. And all because any manifestation of emotions could cause corporal punishment.
