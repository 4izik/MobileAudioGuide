The monumental red brick castle, built next to the Church of Mary of Mongolia, is not a private villa at all, but the oldest Orthodox school in Ottoman Istanbul. The Turks call it simply the Greek Lyceum, and the Greeks themselves - ""The Great School of the Nation"", Oddly enough, Sultan Mehmed conceived to build a school for Christian boys literally immediately after the capture of Constantinople. By such an act, he wanted to attract back to the city the rich Greek merchants who had fled from the war to the countries of Europe and the islands of the Aegean Sea.
Since a lot of attention was paid to education in Byzantium, the Greeks brought the best teachers with them to the new capital of the Ottoman Empire. The patronage of the school was carried out by the Patriarchate of Constantinople.
Just a few years later, the school became one of the most prestigious educational institutions of the Ottoman Empire. Prominent Ottoman figures, including the princes of Moldavia and Wallachia, were educated here.
Among others, the ruler of the Moldavian Principality, a Russian senator and privy councilor of the era of Peter I, as well as a member of the Berlin Academy of Sciences Dmitry Konstantinovich Cantemir graduated from the school. By the way, it was his efforts that paved the road leading to the Greek Lyceum.
At the beginning of the eighteen eighties, the lyceum had a new patron. The Ottoman banker of Greek origin, George Zarifis, allocated a record sum of seventeen thousand gold coins for the construction of a new school building.
Architect Konstantinos Dimidas, not being limited in funds, built a real castle in the then popular Art Nouveau style. Moreover, the bricks for the building were brought all the way from Marseille.
The lyceum carries out its direct functions even now. Education in it can be received not only by boys, but also by girls. That's just the number of seats is limited to a hundred people.
