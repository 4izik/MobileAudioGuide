To the right of the gate of Jebe Ali Bey stands a small house, which during the Ottoman Empire served as a janissary post, and later as the seat of the district police commissioner. There is an interesting story connected with this police station. At the beginning of the last century, the French vaudeville of Henri Kerl and Albert Barre ""The Wedding Night"" became very popular on the theatrical stages of Europe. Inspired by the work, Turkish theatrical figures Muammer Karadja and Refik Kordag decided to adapt the play to the realities of Turkish reality.
Before sitting down to the text, Muammer Karadja witnessed a quarrel between the writer Orhan Hancherlioglu and Rashid Riza, who was appointed to a senior post in the directorate of city theaters. Hancerlioglu was so angry that he did not choose expressions in this dialogue, to which Riza replied: ""Come to your senses, you are not in the Jibali police station.""
This phrase has become a catch phrase in theatrical circles, so the idea to tie the action of the play around the Jibali police station appeared. In this connection, the name ""Wedding Night"" in the Turkish version has changed to ""Jibali Karakol"" (Jibali Police Station).
A funny play telling about the relationship between women and men, the influence of money on people and failures in various institutions was first staged at the opening of the Muammer Karaji Theater. She enjoyed extraordinary success. And over the next sixteen years, she sold out at least three thousand times.
Despite the fact that there is no police station in Semta Jibali and there was no police station, the post of police commissioner thanks to the play became so popular that there was even an official document indicating the address of this place as the Jibali police station.
