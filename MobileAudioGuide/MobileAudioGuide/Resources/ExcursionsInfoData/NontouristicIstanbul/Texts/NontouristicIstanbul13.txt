On the opposite side of the road from the Shep Seifi Khatun Mosque, the monumental arches of the Byzantine Zeyrek cistern rise.
It is not known exactly when it was built. Presumably, like the neighboring monastery of Pantokrator, it was built at the beginning of the twelfth century, during the reign of John II Komnenos. In the years of the Byzantine Empire, this reservoir was called the Pantocrator cistern in part of the adjacent monastery, and only during the Ottoman rule the reservoir received its modern name.
It is curious that Zeirek is one of the few Byzantine cisterns that protrude above the surface of the earth. In addition, it occupies the third place in the ranking of the largest reservoirs of ancient Constantinople. For its intended purpose, the tank was used until the end of the eighteenth century, after which it was abandoned for unknown reasons.
Over the course of a century, the monument of Byzantine times was dilapidated and destroyed, and only in the two thousand and sixth year its large-scale restoration was begun.
