Walking through the streets of Istanbul, there is a feeling that I have come to a real country of cats. And indeed there are so many mustachioed and tailed cats in the city that you can't help but wonder if they are the real owners of the city?
Well-fed, well-groomed cats are found literally everywhere: on the steps of mosques, cafes and restaurants, on benches in parks and in the courtyards of local residents, in large markets and among second-hand bookstores.
For any Turk, a cat is practically a sacred animal. Respect for them was instilled by the Prophet Muhammad.
As the legends say, it was the cat who saved the prophet's life when a snake crawled into the sleeve of his robe. In gratitude, Muhammad gifted the animal with nine lives.
Since then, the cat has been allowed to enter the mosque and listen to the prophet's sermons. And if the beloved cat fell asleep on Muhammad's robe, he preferred to wear a new one so as not to disturb the animal.
There is even a saying in Istanbul that whoever kills a cat must build a mosque to atone for his sin.
And the Turks also believe that after death, all cats go to heaven and can put in a good word to Allah about those who took care of them. Therefore, every local resident considers it his sacred duty to feed, water and warm any stray cat.
Tips in restaurants and cafes often go to pay for the services of a veterinarian, and not eaten food is fed to all animals in the neighborhood. However, the fuzzies reciprocate their love. They protect the homes of local residents from rats and mice, purr pleasantly when you stroke them, and pose with pleasure for numerous tourists against the background of Istanbul attractions.
