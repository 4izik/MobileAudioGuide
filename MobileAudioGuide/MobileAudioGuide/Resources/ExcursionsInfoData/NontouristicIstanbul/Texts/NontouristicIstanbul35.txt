The Kharisi Gate, also known as the Adrianople Gate in the Byzantine Empire and the Edirnekapi Gate in the Ottoman Empire, connected one of the branches of the ancient Mesa with the road leading towards Adrianople, now the city of Edirne, located in the northwestern part of Turkey. At the time of the Byzantines, it was the main civil gate of the city. It was from here that merchant caravans began their long journey to the Adriatic and Bulgaria.
In honor of these gates and the entire surrounding area received its modern name Edirnekapi. For many years it was one of the main Orthodox quarters of the city, until Christians preferred to move closer to the center. Through these gates, on a sunny day on the twenty-ninth of May, one thousand four hundred and fifty-three, the leader Osman Mehmed II on his horse rode triumphantly into the defeated Constantinople. The janissaries lined up on both sides of the road greeted him with loud cheers: ""Fatih!"", ""Fatih!"", ""Glory to the conqueror!"" From here, the sultan went straight to St. Sophia to personally assess the scale of the conquered city.
At the end of the last century, the walls near the Kharisi Gate, which received one of the main blows of the Ottoman army, were partially restored with the money of the UNESCO foundation.
