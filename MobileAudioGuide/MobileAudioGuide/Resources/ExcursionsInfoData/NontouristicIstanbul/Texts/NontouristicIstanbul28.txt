The mosque, built with the money of the military judge Aivaz Efendi, dates back to the second half of the sixteenth century, but we stopped here for a completely different reason. 
It is interesting because it stands on the site of the Great Blachernae Imperial Palace. Two towers of Isaac the Angel and Anemas have been preserved from the Byzantine construction to the present day. In the latter there was an underground prison, which four Byzantine emperors and major political criminals managed to visit at once over the years of its existence.
The first prisoner of the prison was the commander Mikhail Anemas, who landed in the casemates after a conspiracy against Alexei | Komnenos. It was in his honor that the tower got its name.
Andronikos I Komnenos, the future Patriarch of Constantinople John XI, and the Byzantine Emperor Andronikos IV Palaiologos, along with his sons Manuel and Theodore, also visited here.
Despite the severity of the imprisonment, the prison of Anemas can hardly be called a ""tower of oblivion"". None of the high-ranking prisoners, with the exception of Andronik I, has spent his entire life here. Basically, these casemates were used to eliminate political opponents, which did not prevent them from coming to power after a while anyway. Prisoners were allowed to stay in their cells with their family and servants, meet friends here and read books. Prisoners often attempted to escape, and some of them succeeded.
After the Ottoman conquest of Constantinople, the towers were abandoned to their fate. To this day they have been preserved in a dilapidated form. The entrance to the casemates was closed with a fence for safety. However, even in such an unpresentable form, they remind of the former splendor of Constantinople.
