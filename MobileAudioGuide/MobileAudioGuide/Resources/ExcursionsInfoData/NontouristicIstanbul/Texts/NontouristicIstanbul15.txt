In front of the Ataturk Bridge, the historic district of Jibali stretches along the western shore of the Golden Horn Bay.
It got its name in honor of the brave janissary Jebe Ali Bey, who during the capture of Constantinople managed to break through the gates from the bay and break into the city. At first, the name of Ali Bey was called only the gate, but later it spread to the surrounding area.
At all times, it was one of the poorest places in Istanbul, its inhabitants were mainly engaged in servicing ships in the Golden Horn, ensuring their waterproofness.
This process involved sealing the cracks with fibrous materials: hemp, tow or wool and further coating them with hot resin.
Flammable components and constantly burning fires here and there often led to destructive fires. With an easterly wind, they almost completely destroyed the wooden huts, modestly climbing to the top of the hill. For this, Jibali was nicknamed the most fire-hazardous area of the city.
At the end of the nineteenth century, the socio-economic life of the quarter changed after a tobacco factory was built here. The enterprise was so large that, in fact, it represented a small town with its own officials, police, fire department, hospital, school and shops.
However, both the tobacco factory and the shipyard were moved out of the district at the end of the last century, and the remaining premises were occupied by the buildings of Kadir Has University.
Today, as hundreds of years ago, the middle and lower strata of the population live in this area. Relatively few historical sights have been preserved here, but there is a unique opportunity to look at another, non-fancy and non-touristic Istanbul.
