The Venetian by birth turned out to be at the Ottoman court as a boy. The future Sultan Selim II persuaded him to become a eunuch, and later, with the support of Haseki Selim Nurban, Sultan Gazanfer agha rose to the head of the white eunuchs, becoming one of the most influential persons in the Topkapi Palace.
It was the women with whom he participated in intrigues and conspiracies that helped him maintain his power for thirty years under the rule of three sultans. However, Mehmed III, incited by the janissaries and having a personal dislike for Gazanfer-aga, decided to get rid of him by entrusting the care of the harem to black eunuchs. The disgraced guard was buried in a turban erected on the territory of his own madrasah.

However, recent public protests have led to the fact that today the complex is occupied by the cultural and educational center of the Aziz Mahmoud Khudai Foundation.
