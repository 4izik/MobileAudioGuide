Our walk begins at the small Martyrs' Square on the sixteenth of March at the exit of the metro station "Vesnedzhiler". This station of the Green line, lying at a depth of thirty meters below ground level, is considered one of the deepest in the Istanbul subway network. It connects the historical center of the city with the northern districts of its European part. The station was opened on the sixteenth of March, two thousand of the fourteenth year, on the day of remembrance of the officers of the Ottoman police who died during a clash with British troops during the occupation of Constantinople, nineteen hundred and twentieth year. The background of this siege was the shameful defeat of the Ottomans in the First World War. According to the Mudros Truce, the territory of the former Ottoman Empire was occupied by the armies of the allies of the Entente countries. Taking advantage of this, the Greek troops tried to regain historical territories, including Constantinople. Istanbul was never given to the Greeks, but most of the European cities, including Izmir with its environs in Asia Minor, according to the Sevres Peace Treaty was supposed to go in favor of Greece. The local population considered this contract bonded. The last Sultan of the Ottoman Empire, Mehmed VI, increasingly lost confidence and the revolutionary-minded population began to unite under the command of the Ottoman general Mustafa Kemal Ataturk. As a result, the Chamber of Deputies, created by the decision of the new government, adopted the "Declaration of Independence of Turkey" in January, nineteen hundred and twentieth, which provoked the Entente powers to send troops to Constantinople and begin hostilities against the self-proclaimed Turkish Republic.
