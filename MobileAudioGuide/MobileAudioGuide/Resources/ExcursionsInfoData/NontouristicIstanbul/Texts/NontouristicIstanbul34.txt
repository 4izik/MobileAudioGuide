The small church of St. George was located near the Adrianople Gate in Byzantine times. It is not known for certain when the first temple was built at the highest point of Constantinople. But it is proved that already at the beginning of the eighth century, Emperor Constantine V destroyed the old church and rebuilt it.
In this form, with minor alterations and restorations, it existed until the conquest of the city by the Ottomans.
The sultans did not pay due attention to the church, so it was dilapidated and destroyed. By the middle of the sixteenth century, it was decided to demolish the temple altogether, and to build a grand mosque Mihrimah Sultan on the vacant site.
Nevertheless, the Orthodox community rebuilt it anew, though in a much more modest size. The modern building was erected in one thousand eight hundred and thirty-sixth year according to the drawings of the Greek architect Nikolaus, after the previous building collapsed during another earthquake.
Nowadays, this modest temple belongs to the Georgian community of Istanbul.
