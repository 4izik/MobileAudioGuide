It has many names: the Church of One Day, as the locals call it; the church of keys or the church of wish fulfillment, as tourists call it; the Church of St. Mary, as it was called earlier. There have been many more names for the entire existence of this church. But this is the only Byzantine church in Constantinople that has never been converted into a mosque and has always remained open to the Greek Orthodox Church. It has a four-petalled plan with a central dome surrounded by a tower, which makes it a unique part of the Byzantine architecture of Constantinople. Although the building has always remained in Greek hands, it has been significantly modified, unlike those church buildings from which it was made into a mosque. 
The history of the church dates back to the beginning of the seventh century, when Princess Sopatra, daughter of the Byzantine Emperor Mauricius, together with Eustolia built a monastery on the slope of the fifth hill of Constantinople. The land that was granted by the emperor lay to the north of the Aspar Cistern and was used as a cemetery until then. The church building was dedicated to Saint Eustolius. In the eleventh century, a monastery was attached to it. It was dedicated to all saints and had a close connection with the monastery of the Great Lavra on Mount Athos. During the Latin domination after the Fourth Crusade, the monastery disappeared.
In one thousand two hundred and sixty-first year, after the conquest of the city by the Byzantines, Isaac Duka, father-in-law of George the Acropolite and maternal uncle of Michael VIII Palaiologos, rebuilt it into a simple one-story monastery dedicated to Our Lady Panagotissa. 
In one thousand two hundred and eighty-one, Maria Palaiologos, illegitimate daughter of Emperor Michael VIII and widow of Abaka, Khan of the Mongol Il-Khanate, returned to Constantinople after a fifteen-year absence. It is said that she rebuilt the monastery and the church, which at that time took the form that we see today. This earned her the title of the founder of this church complex. 
The monastery existed until the end of the empire, and then was abandoned. But on the twenty-ninth of May, one thousand four hundred and fifty-third, on the day of the fall of Constantinople, in the vicinity of the building there was the last desperate resistance of the Greeks against the invading Ottomans. Because of this, the church received the Turkish name ""Kanli Kilise"", which means ""Church of Blood"", and the road leading to it from the Golden Horn is still called the Ascent of the Standard-Bearer in honor of the Ottoman standard-bearer who found his death fighting here.
According to legend, Sultan Mehmed II granted the church to the Greek architect of the Fatih Mosque in recognition of his work. The grant was confirmed by Bayezid II in recognition of the merits of the nephew of Christodoulos, who built a mosque with the name of the sultan.
Under Sultans Selim I and Ahmed II, there were two attempts by the Ottoman Empire to turn the church into a mosque, but thanks to grants from Mehmed II and Bayezid II, the church remained a parish of the Greek community. Thus, the Church of One Day is one of the few Byzantine churches in Istanbul, the ancient dedication of which has never been forgotten.
The building was damaged several times in one thousand six hundred and thirty-three, one thousand six hundred and forty and one thousand seven hundred and twenty-nine by fires that devastated the Fener, the building was repaired and expanded, completely losing its primitive elegance. At the end of the nineteenth century, a small school was built next to it, and in one thousand eight hundred and ninety-two, a small bell tower was added. In nineteen fifty-five, the church was damaged during the Istanbul pogrom, but since then it has been restored.
