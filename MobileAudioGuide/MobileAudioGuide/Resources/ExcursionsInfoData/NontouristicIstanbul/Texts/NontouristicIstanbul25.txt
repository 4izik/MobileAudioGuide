The Greek quarter of Phanar is bordered by the historical semt Balat, which during the Ottoman Empire was considered the main center of compact residence of the Jewish community. Balat got its name from the Latin ""palatium"" - the palace, in memory of the imperial palace located nearby.
The first Jews settled here at the end of the fifteenth century, when the ruling Sultan Bayezid II allowed the Sephardim expelled from Spain to settle in the capital of the growing empire. Jews quickly settled in new places and built about twenty synagogues in the district, the largest and oldest of which, the Ahrid Synagogue, is still operating today.
Until the end of the nineteenth century, Balat grew and prospered. However, a further earthquake and a series of devastating fires forced the residents of the quarter to move to neighboring Galata, and after the declaration of independence of Israel, most of the Istanbul Jews chose to leave for their historical homeland.
Abandoned houses were quickly populated by poor segments of the population: Kurds, Gypsies and Anatolian migrants. Unfortunately, they care little about the appearance of buildings, so the area is gradually collapsing and decaying.
Nevertheless, in recent years, Semt Balat has fallen in love with local hipsters, who have opened many cozy and authentic cafes and art galleries here.
Multicolored Jewish houses, numerous graffiti, and everywhere hung linen attract fans to take colorful photos here. The most striking of them will turn out on Kiremit Street and the steep stairs of Mardivanli Yokush Evleri (Merdivenli Yoku≈ü Evleri).
