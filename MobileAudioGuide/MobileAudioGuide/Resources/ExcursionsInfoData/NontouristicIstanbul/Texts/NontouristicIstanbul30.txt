The Church of the Mother of God, as well as the imperial palace, is often called the Blachernae, in honor of the area in which they were located.
For centuries, Blachernae was considered the northwestern suburb of Constantinople. Moreover, at the time of the construction of the Feodosian walls, this area was not yet included in the city limits, despite the fact that the church with priceless relics of Christianity, erected by Empress Pulcheria, already existed.
The very name of Blachernae arose from the name of a certain Vlach who arrived in Constantinople from the lands in the lower reaches of the Danube. Who this man was, and what happened to him, history is silent. Some scientists believe that he was killed in these parts, others that he founded the settlement of the Wallachians, who later gave the name to the quarter.
As it really was, it is difficult to establish today, but it is known for certain that by the beginning of the seventh century the Blachernae became the fourteenth district of Constantinople.
At about the same time, Emperor Heraclius surrounded the district with powerful fortress walls, which the Byzantines strengthened even more during the Komnenos dynasty, who made the Blachernae Palace the official imperial residence.
Under them, this area reached its heyday, but the Latins who had already come to power lost any interest in it. Paleologists tried to breathe life back here, but the area never reached its former greatness.
Nowadays, the Blachernae have become part of the Turkish district of Ayvansaray, populated mainly by poor segments of the population.
