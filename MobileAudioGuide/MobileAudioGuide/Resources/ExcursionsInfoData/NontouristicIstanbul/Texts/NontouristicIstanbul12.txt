The modest red-and-white Shep Sefa Hatn Mosque rises from the eastern side of Ataturk Boulevard.
It was built on the instructions of one of the wives of Sultan Abdul Hamid I, Fatma Shebsefa Hatn, at the end of the eighteenth century in the typical Ottoman Baroque style of those times.
Abdul Hamid himself was quite a loving sultan. Only he had at least nine official wives, although some sources indicate the figure of fifteen and even seventeen.
Fatma Shebsefa Hat”≥n was the Sultan's sixth official wife. Her firstborn, Mehmed, died at the age of three. After the boy, the woman managed to give birth to three more daughters, but only one of them was able to survive her father and mother.
In memory of her untimely children, the inconsolable mother decided to build this mosque. On the instructions of the sultan's wife, a fountain and an elementary school for girls were built next to the shrine, which allowed Fatma Shebsefa Khatun to gain a reputation as a pioneer of Ottoman women's education.
In one thousand eight hundred and five, the philanthropist was buried in the cemetery in the courtyard of her own mosque. Unfortunately, this yard was noticeably cut during the construction of Ataturk Boulevard. During the work, both the school and the fountain had to be demolished, but a modest mosque and the grave of the founder on its territory can still be found today.
