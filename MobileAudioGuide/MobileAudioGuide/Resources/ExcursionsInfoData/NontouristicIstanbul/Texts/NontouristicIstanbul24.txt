The tavern ""Agora"", as the sign on the facade says, was opened in the distant one thousand eight hundred and ninety by the Greek captain Asteris Dulidis. It was in memory of his distant homeland that Dulidis named this place ""Agora"" or ""Market Square"". However, initially the cafe was located at the Balatsky bazaar Chifit.
The people loved the ""Agora"" for its unusual interior: massive wine barrels were used as tables in the institution.
After the Istanbul pogroms of nineteen fifty-five, only memories remained of the ancient tavern. And the grandson of Asteri Dulidis Hristo bought a new place for the family cafe on the shore of the Golden Horn between two ancient walls.
The southern one was built at the beginning of the fifth century by the Byzantine emperor Theodosius II, as part of the city fortifications, and the northern wall was used by the Jews of Constantinople as an external part of the funeral home from the year eight hundred and ninth to one thousand nine hundred and seventy.
Thanks to its authentic atmosphere, the Agora Tavern was often seen in the frames of famous Turkish films. In total, about two hundred and eighty-six local films were shot here, scenes from which are captured in photographs in the interior.
Like a century and a half ago, this cafe is still extremely popular today, invariably occupying the top positions in the ratings of the most authentic restaurants in Istanbul.
